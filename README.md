About
=====
This is a simple little In/Out board I wrote years ago in Django to replace a super ugly, nasty, text-file-backed Perl app that was abandoned.  It was a way for me to exercise my Python chops and learn a little something about web application development, too.  Plus, there was a little sys admin survival motive.  I was tired of constantly getting asked to update the "database" of the old app when new people came or went or remarried or whatever.

Quickstart

Both of these directories need to go into the web root you configure apache to point at (for example, /home/django/).
